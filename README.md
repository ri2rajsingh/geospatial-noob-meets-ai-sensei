## The Problem

Despite 5+ years of satellite imagery expertise, creating machine learning models in Google Earth Engine remained frustratingly difficult:
- Complex server-side programming paradigm
- Confusing error messages and debugging
- Overwhelming dataset options
- Training data optimization challenges

**Result**: Years of failed attempts at object detection models.

## The Breakthrough

Large Language Models (LLMs) transformed everything:
- **Code generation**: Minutes instead of days
- **Error debugging**: Real-time troubleshooting
- **Dataset guidance**: Optimal imagery selection
- **Training optimization**: Balanced, high-quality datasets

**Result**: 99% accurate brick kiln detection model in Ludhiana, Punjab.

## Three Real Use Cases

### 1. Brick Kiln Detection (Industrial Monitoring)
- **Area**: Ludhiana, Punjab
- **Accuracy**: 99% detection rate
- **Discovery**: Kilns cluster naturally (contrary to initial assumptions)

### 2. Crop Stubble Burning (District Analysis)
- **Challenge**: Map % area of stubble burning in Punjab district
- **Output**: Heat maps + peak burning period identification
- **Impact**: Environmental policy support

### 3. Regional Stubble Monitoring (State-wide Scale)
- **Scope**: All Punjab districts
- **Analysis**: District-by-district burning percentages
- **Timeline**: Weekly peak burning identification

## Quick Start (30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geospatial-noob-meets-ai-sensei.git

# 2. Choose your use case
cd case-studies/01-brick-kiln-detection/
# OR cd case-studies/02-stubble-burning-district/
# OR cd case-studies/03-stubble-burning-punjab/

# 3. Copy script to GEE Code Editor
# 4. Replace placeholder asset paths
# 5. Run and watch the magic happen
```

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Detection Accuracy | 99% |
| Processing Time | <5 minutes |
| Study Area | Ludhiana, Punjab (400 km²) |
| Detected Kilns | 150+ locations |
| False Positives | <1% |

## Proven Prompt Templates

### Object Detection Starter
```markdown
Create a Google Earth Engine script to detect [OBJECT] in [REGION].

Object characteristics:
- Visual: [red/clustered/geometric patterns]
- Location: [near roads/outside cities/industrial areas]
- Size: [typical dimensions]

Requirements:
- Use Sentinel-2 imagery (2023)
- Include spectral indices (NDVI, NDBI)
- Add texture features
- Random Forest classifier
- Export results as shapefile
```

### Error Debugging
```markdown
I'm getting this GEE error: [paste error message]

My code: [paste relevant code section]

Please identify the issue and provide corrected code.
```

## Methodology Highlights

### Feature Engineering
- **Spectral bands**: RGB, NIR, SWIR (6 bands)
- **Vegetation indices**: NDVI, NDBI, BSI, MSAVI
- **Custom indices**: Red-enhancing index for brick kilns
- **Texture features**: GLCM contrast, correlation, variance

### Training Data Strategy
1. **Initial dataset**: 60 positive + 60 negative samples
2. **Iterative balancing**: Fixed class imbalance issues
3. **Quality control**: Removed ambiguous samples
4. **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified validation

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest (50 trees)
- **Output**: Probability maps + binary classification
- **Post-processing**: Minimum size filtering (0.5 ha)
- **Validation**: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score

## Applications Beyond These Use Cases

This AI-assisted methodology works for any geospatial detection challenge:
- **Industrial**: Solar farms, mining sites, factories
- **Agricultural**: Crop health, irrigation patterns, livestock facilities  
- **Urban**: Building footprints, road networks, parking areas
- **Environmental**: Deforestation, water quality, land degradation

*Three diverse use cases prove the methodology's versatility*

## Success Stories

### Brick Kiln Detection - Ludhiana
**Challenge**: Environmental monitoring of industrial pollution
**Solution**: AI-assisted ML model in GEE  
**Result**: 99% accuracy, complete spatial mapping
**Key Learning**: Clustered results were actually correct - kilns do cluster due to shared infrastructure, raw materials, and economic factors

### Crop Stubble Burning - District Level
**Challenge**: Map burning intensity and timing for policy support
**Solution**: Heat map generation with temporal analysis
**Result**: Identified 3-week peak burning period + percentage area calculations

### Regional Monitoring - Punjab State
**Challenge**: Scale analysis across all districts
**Solution**: Extended district model to state-wide coverage
**Result**: District-by-district burning percentages + individual district peak periods

## Getting Started Guide

- Basic remote sensing knowledge

### Step 1: Prepare Training Data
1. Identify 50+ positive examples of your target object
2. Collect 50+ negative examples (similar but different features)
3. Ensure geographic spread across study area
4. Export as GEE FeatureCollections

### Step 2: Generate Initial Code
Use prompt templates in `/prompts/code-generation.md` with your LLM of choice.

### Step 3: Iterative Improvement
1. Run initial model
2. Analyze false positives/negatives
3. Update training data
4. Use debugging prompts for errors
5. Repeat until satisfied

### Step 4: Validation & Export

## Troubleshooting

### Common GEE Errors
| Error | Cause | AI-Assisted Solution |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| "Object on server" | Client/server confusion | Use .getInfo() sparingly |
| Memory limit exceeded | Large computations | Reduce scale, use tileScale |
| Asset not found | Incorrect path | Check asset permissions |
