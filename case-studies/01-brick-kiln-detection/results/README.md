# Results - Brick Kiln Detection

## Performance Assessment
- **Visual validation**: Excellent detection accuracy across test area
- **Clustering patterns**: Successfully identified natural kiln clusters
- **Spatial precision**: Clean separation between kiln and non-kiln areas
- **False positives**: Minimal misclassification observed

## Detection Results
- **Study area**: Ludhiana district (400 km²)
- **Detected features**: 150+ brick kiln locations
- **Processing challenges**: Memory limitations due to area size
- **Key insight**: Kilns cluster naturally around infrastructure

## Technical Limitations & Learnings

### Computational Constraints
- **Memory limits**: Hit GEE memory ceiling due to 400 km² study area
- **Processing challenges**: Required multiple optimization passes
- **Non-enterprise compute**: Standard GEE limits affected large-area analysis
- **Workarounds**: Used tileScale, reduced resolution for exports

### Next Steps for Scaling
- **Enterprise GEE**: Access to higher memory limits
- **Cloud computing**: Enhanced processing power for larger regions
- **Batch processing**: Divide large areas into manageable chunks
- **Optimization**: Further code efficiency improvements
